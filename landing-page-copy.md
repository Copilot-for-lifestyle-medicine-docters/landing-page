## Problem

### Label

The Cost of Waiting

### Headline

We diagnose too late — and pay the price.

### Bullets

- 1 in 10 adults in Belgium has diabetes.
- 1 in 3 doesn’t even know it yet.
- Clinical labs already hold the warning signs, but today’s tools miss the early patterns.

## Guide

### Headline

We’re scientists, clinicians, and engineers on a mission to end reactive medicine.

### Body

Founded by a pharmacist, an AI engineer, and a neuroscientist, Eliksir builds AI for preventive and longevity medicine.
We help labs move beyond traditional reference ranges — spotting subtle dysfunctions long before disease begins.

### Visual Note

From Sick Care → Preventive Care.

## Plan

### Headline

How It Works

### Steps

1. **Integrate Eliksir AI** — Plug into your existing lab data or API.
2. **Enhance Lab Reports** — Deliver optimized, doctor-friendly insights.
3. **Empower Preventive Care** — Help doctors detect risks early, and labs grow loyalty + revenue.

### Subline

You keep the lab. We enhance its intelligence.

## Stakes

- Chronic diseases already cost Europe €207 billion per year.
- Every missed early marker means another life altered, another cost added.
- Labs that don’t adapt risk becoming just data factories — instead of leaders in the preventive era.

## Success

### Headline

From lab reports to health intelligence.

### Body

With Eliksir, your lab becomes the bridge between data and prevention.
Together, we can reduce premature deaths from chronic disease by one-third by 2030.

## Algorithm

### Headline

The hybrid core that powers preventive interpretation.

### Subline

Hard-coded clinical rules fused with referenced intelligence to surface risk years earlier.

### Highlights

- **Deterministic spine** Clinically validated thresholds stay in control through golden-rule logic.
- **Trusted references** Retrieval-augmented explanations cite the medical sources physicians rely on.
- **Pattern detection** Our risk-tracking algorithm maps subtle biomarker shifts years before symptoms surface.
